# advent-of-code-2022
ðŸŽ„ My solutions of the programming puzzles in JavaScript and/or Python.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Check out https://adventofcode.com for further information.


## Run solutions
The puzzles are ordered by day. Each daily folder contains a task description (readme file), the input file and a solution file. 
The solutions are either written in JavaScript, Python or in Python Jupyter Notebook and can be run independently.
No special modules are used.


## Style of the code
I attempt to develop a standalone, simple, and easy to understand solution for each problem (two each day).
Most solution steps are commented and the variable names are chosen to increase understanding of what's going on.
